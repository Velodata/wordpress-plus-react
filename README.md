# Getting Started with the Wordpress + React Tutorial

This tutorial was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Please Note:  This tutorial is deliberately rather bland at an appearance level.  
The reason for this is simple;  the goal is NOT to show you how to create a pretty website
but rather,  the goal is to how you how to obtain JSON data from the Wordpress API using the AXIOS library from within a React application.
It is assumed you are capable of designing a "pretty website" yourself.

If however,  you would like to see an example of a "pretty website" please visit https://news.velodata.org
